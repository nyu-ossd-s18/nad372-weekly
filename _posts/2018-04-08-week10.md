### Reflection on Invited Talk
I thought the talk was interesting. I appreciated the honesty in that Google does keep some algorithms proprietary like self driving cars, searching, etc. I am interested in Bazel and what it has the potential to do. I also appreciate Google's view that things are better the Open Source way. I think it's cool that the software used for building is open source so that a lot of people praciticing software development are on the same wavelength with the same technology. 

### Code of Conduct

Having this document makes sure that the community adheres to rules that make contirbuting easy and safe. People can be be friendly and communicate well. If there are rude developers and contributors people will not be inclined to help. Zulip has a code of conduct this is the link: http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code-of-conduct.html

The code of conduct creates a safe environment for people to work in. You are more likely to get a response when you're polite.

### Project Progress
We have been trying to trace the difference between a successful and unsuccessful change for a week. It is a lot harder than we anticipated because it is a backend issue. I tried to follow the direction Tom gave about adding the new users to the stream and I added some code to the actions.py file but it did not work.  
My specific task is to try and modify the python file so that it accepts the current user in the ums array.
