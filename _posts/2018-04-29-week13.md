title: Week 13

I learned how to work with a large code base. How to focus on small problems and work backward to find the fix given I don't know the code. I learned to assess situations I can fix -- bugs I can work on. I learned how to work better with a team and the impacts of open source. 

If I could change one thing it would be to start working on the project much earlier, it's easier to understand open source once you get your feet wet.
